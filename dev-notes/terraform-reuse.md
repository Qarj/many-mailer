Yes, you can and should reuse the same remote state infrastructure (the S3 bucket and DynamoDB lock table) across multiple projects. That’s a common pattern.

How to reuse

- Use the same bucket and lock table but different keys per project/workspace so each project’s state is isolated.
- The only thing you change per project is the key in backend.tf.

Example backend.tf for another project (reusing the same bucket/table)
terraform {
backend "s3" {
bucket = "many-mailer-tf-state-381354916781-eu-west-1"
key = "other-project/terraform.tfstate" # change this path
region = "eu-west-1"
dynamodb_table = "tf-locks"
encrypt = true
}
}

Good key naming patterns

- one-repo-per-project:
  - key = "infra/terraform.tfstate" (what you have now)
- multiple stacks/environments in one repo:
  - key = "infra/dev/terraform.tfstate"
  - key = "infra/prod/terraform.tfstate"
- multiple projects sharing the same bucket:
  - key = "project-a/terraform.tfstate"
  - key = "project-b/terraform.tfstate"

Tips

- Bucket: keep it global per account/region. Many orgs use a single “tf-state” bucket per account-region and store all states as different keys/paths.
- Lock table: one DynamoDB table (tf-locks) can be shared by all states; Terraform uses the LockID to isolate locks.
- Permissions: ensure your deploy role has read/write access to that bucket prefix and lock table. With AdministratorAccess you’re covered now; for least privilege, scope to:
  - s3:ListBucket for the bucket
  - s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteObject on the specific key prefix you use
  - dynamodb:DescribeTable and basic item operations on tf-locks

Optional: bootstrap via Terraform later

- You can create the state bucket and lock table via a one-time “bootstrap” Terraform stack that uses local state or a different backend. Many teams do:
  - bootstrap/ (local state) creates the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table
  - infra/ uses the S3 backend you created
    This avoids manual steps, but what you have now is perfectly fine.

Bottom line

- Yes, reuse the same S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for multiple projects.
- Just use unique key paths in backend.tf to keep states separate.
